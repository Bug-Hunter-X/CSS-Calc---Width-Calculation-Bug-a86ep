To solve the layout issues, consider using a more explicit approach to calculating the width:

```css
div {
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Include padding and border in the element's total width and height */
  width: 49%; /* Adjust this percentage for the desired effect */
  margin: 0 1%; /* Adjust margin as needed */
}
```
This revised CSS utilizes a simpler percentage width and adjusts the margin.  Using `box-sizing: border-box` ensures padding and border widths are included within the 49% width. This approach provides greater cross-browser consistency.
