The following CSS code snippet causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This uses `calc()` to calculate the width of a div, subtracting 10px from 50% of the container's width. However, some browsers may interpret this incorrectly, leading to unexpected layout issues.
